Tic - Tac - Toe

A pop culture take on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game: two celebrity rivals are feuding to take over the world of hip-hop (represented as the tic-tac-toe board, naturally). Who will win? You decide!

So here it is, a website that lets you play tic tac toe. This is how I designed it:

Wireframe:

![Not literally a frame built of wires but, pretty close] https://imgur.com/PVS1vMF

Data Structures to be used: Objects, strings, booleans, numbers, possibly null as well

I will represent the gameboard with either divs or a table

I plan to apprach this project by reviewing the skills I have learned so far, looking at the API to see what data is required and how it should be structured, and by checking out other tic tac toe projects to see if I understand their logic.

User Stories:

"<game player> will <log in> to page"
'<game player> will <create an account>
 <game player> will <sign out>
 <game player> will <plot a move> on <gameboard>
 <game player> will <plot another move>
 <game player> will <play again>'
'<user> will <create a username and password>
  <username> and <password> are <stored>
    a <blank game card> '

Game modularity: I will keep my code modular by separating my javascript, html, and CSS into proper categories, utilizing objects and methods to keep my code DRY and extensivly researching code layout and structure to pick a code style that works well.

Creative Spin: My tic tac toe game will have a pop culture theme

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery

Unsolved problems to be fixed: Connecting with the API to save and store games and connect them to authenticated users. I would love to make the style of the website more aesthetically pleasing. I will make images of Cardi B pop up instead of an "x", and Nicki Minaj will pop up instead of an "o".

Version control: I will git commit and grunt deploy early and often

Additional features: option to play against the computer
